# weather-app
A weather app used made to learn ReactJs, NodeJs, TailwindCSS, and basic API handling 


My react learning method was only through official react documentation as I wanted to test my own ability to learn from docs given my coding knowledge progression without having to rely on a myriad of youtube tutorials and other resources.
